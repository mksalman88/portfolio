Dream: Opa was (still?) alive (again?). We were on the subway and I was hugging him tightly, burying my face in his chest. He didn’t pull away, the way he usually does.

Dream: A cut on the top of my hand. Giving into a strange urge, I widen the wound, remove a piece of skin and flesh. Remove a shard from my body. My hand: hollow. The bottom face: smaller, like a child’s. The real me existed only in the moment I was born: empty, to be occupied (by ego).

(Sofia’s) Dream: I was still part of my youth council back in Lima. Greenday was there and they brought me up on stage. That’s when I spotted her in the crowd. She hugged me tight, just like last time. That was before Tuesday, before she became the Sunset. 

How some dreams, when you’re inside them, feel like they’re both unequivocally real yet impossible. How when you’re dreaming, fragments of memory blow across the mind like the autumn breeze parting a sea of fallen leaves.

One theory posits that Visión Fantasmal came to Goya in a dream.

If a leaf falls in a forest with no one around, does it still make a sound?

Beads of sweat /
underneath the sheets /
I kiss your lips /
You help me breathe 

Skin on skin /
Your chest on mine /
You kiss my neck /
Send shivers down my spine 

I look into your eyes /
I don’t mean to cry 

4am /
please don’t leave /
You whisper in my ear / 
I’m not going anywhere, but here /
6 years pass /
I’m still in love with you 

But I think I miss you more /
Than I remember you /

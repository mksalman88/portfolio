Outtake 1:
Do you believe in god? /
I don’t believe in anything. /
You must believe in something… /
What about Ants? 

I guess I believe in Ants. /

Outtake 2:
Do you feel like you’re unique? /
Not really. Not in the grand scheme of things, at least. /
I like to think that all the Ants are unique. That each one has a special job and function. 

Did you know that there are some species of Ants that enslave other Ants?

Outtake 3:
Look at the faces in that building facade – none of them are the same. /
See? Even there the Ants are different. /
And those are just statues. 

Outtake 4:
Time just moves. It just flies by… unless you grab it… like this piece of pollen. /
I think the more you try to grab it, the faster it moves. /

Maybe. Maybe it moves more slowly when you stay present. /

Like the time I saw the stars in Andalusia. /
When you really take it all in, you feel like the universe is engulfing you. /
You feel this notion of oneness. /

Dude, look at those Ants.

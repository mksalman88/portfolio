‘It sounds like you hear the music — maybe you just need to listen’ 
We were talking about the absurdity of perceived perception
About how there is nothing more psychedelic than life itself
How dissociation feels akin to falling
How maybe, if you can control it, it feels more like levitation
Maybe that’s the difference between nihilism and emptiness
Maybe
when you stop conflating the two you worry less
about the end 
of everything

The closest I ever came to killing myself was in a dream

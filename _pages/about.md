I am an urban strategist and data scientist with a background in physics and urban planning. I thrive at the intersection of technical depth and real-world application, synthesizing complex subject-matter into actionable insights. My focus is on data-driven and design-based projects in the context of the built environment. In my spare time, I pursue my passion for poetry and songwriting.
